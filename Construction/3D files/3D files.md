All the 3D parts required for the modulator can be found here in both STL and solidworks (SLDPRT) formats.  
I chose these formats because 1) they were made in solidworks, and 2) I figured STL should be versatile enough for those who dont have solidworks.  
I will most likely include some other format thats compatible with a free and/or open source CAD program if I find one that seems suitable.
